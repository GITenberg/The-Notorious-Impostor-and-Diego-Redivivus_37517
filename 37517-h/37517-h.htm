INTRODUCTION
</p>

<br>
<p>
The great English novel of the eighteenth century was developed out of
the long established traditions in the essay, letter, religious
treatise, biography and personal memoir. Although this influence has
been generally acknowledged, the critical investigation of its exact
nature has often been hampered by the lack of readily available texts.
Especially is this true of the criminal biographies written in the late
seventeenth century. The reprinting of Elkanah Settle's <i>The
Notorious Impostor</i> (Part One) and the anonymous <i>Diego
Redivivus</i> is thus justified as providing the means for the further
study of the early fiction-writer's techniques. Published In 1692, the
two pamphlets belong to a group of five closely-related narratives
dealing with a real criminal named William Morrell. In the probable
order of their publication, these were <i>Diego Redivivus</i>, <i>The
Notorious Impostor</i> (Part One), <i>The Second Part of the Notorious
Impostor</i>, "<i>William Morrell's</i> Epitaph" in <i>The Gentleman's
Journal</i>, and <i>The Compleat Memoirs of the Life of that Notorious
Impostor Will. Morrell</i>. The different accounts forcefully
demonstrate how criminal fiction allied itself with both biography and
the picaresque. In addition, <i>The Notorious Impostor</i> serves as a
representative work by Elkanah Settle whose criminal biographies have
never received the attention they deserve.<a href="#note1" name="noteref1">
<small>[1]</small></a>
</p>

<p>
The combination of fact and fiction in the William Morrell narratives
had been tried earlier in Settle's first known criminal biography,
<i>The Life and Death of Major Clancie, the Grandest Cheat of this
Age</i> (1680). Like Bunyan's <i>Mr. Badman</i>, advertised in the same
issue of <i>The Term Catalogues</i> (I, 382), <i>Major Clancie</i>
purports to narrate "Real matter of Fact." Thus, in the background,
significant historical events, from the Irish Rebellion to the Great
Fire, are being enacted. Important English worthies&#8212;Lord Ormonde,
Bishop Compton, Charles II&#8212;become entangled in the villainies of the
Major, an actual Irish criminal. None of this historical backdrop is to
be found, however, in <i>The Notorious Impostor</i>; and the characters
here, although Sir William Walters and Humphrey Wickham were well-known
local personages, are not historically eminent. The picaresque in
<i>Major Clancie</i>, too, is more readily identifiable than in <i>The
Notorious Impostor</i>. For, contrary to its stated aim, the biography
of Clancie is more fiction than fact. Anthony Wood, noting the
fictional elaborations, remarked: "Several stories in this book which
belong to other persons are fathered on the said major; who, as I
remember, was in Oxon in the plague year 1665 when the king and the
queen kept their respective courts there."<a href="#note2" name="noteref2">
<small>[2]</small></a> Wood then contributes a
few of his own pungent stories about the Major, which have no
counterparts in Settle's narrative. Where the two writers provide
parallel accounts, the "fiction" appears to be based on a substratum of
truth surviving in anecdotes. Settle's verisimilitude had an effect
upon Theophilus Lucas's <i>Memoirs of the Lives, Intrigues, and Comical
Adventures of the Most Famous Gamesters and Celebrated Sharpers</i>
(1714), which begins with a condensed version of <i>The Life and Death
of Major Clancie</i>.<a href="#note3" name="noteref3">
<small>[3]</small></a> Lucas presents his account as if it were a
true memoir.
</p>

<br>

<p>
<i>The Notorious Impostor</i> was to experience a similar acceptance as
a memoir. All modern biographical accounts of its villain-hero, William
Morrell,<a href="#note4" name="noteref4">
<small>[4]</small></a> are based on the two separate parts of <i>The Notorious
Impostor</i> or <i>The Compleat Memoirs</i>. On January 3, 1692, he had
died, a criminal at large; and the strange circumstances of his death
became the talk of London. While the event was still a sensation, the
bookseller Abel Roper rushed his "last will and testament" lives into
print. The first to appear was <i>Diego Redivivus</i>, reprinted here
from the rare copy at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library.
Evidence for the publication of <i>Diego Redivivus</i> before <i>The
Notorious Impostor</i> is fairly conclusive. <i>The Registers of the
Worshipful Company of Stationers</i> (III, 397) enters <i>Diego
Redivivus</i>, on behalf of Abel Roper, for January 12, 1692, and
<i>The Term Catalogues</i> (II, 392) advertises <i>The Notorious
Impostor</i> in the quarterly issue published in February, but Anthony
Wood (III, 384) states that he bought his copy of the latter "in the
beginning of March." A comparison of the two texts, moreover, supports
this order of the publication.
</p>

<p>
Events in <i>Diego Redivivus</i>, as in a news story, have greater
immediacy. Morrell's death, the title asserts, took place the third of
"this instant January." The specific detail of <i>Diego</i> (p. 2:
"about a fortnight before <i>Christmas</i>") is paralleled by the
general statement of <i>The Notorious Impostor</i> (p. 30: "Some few
days before <i>Christmas</i>"). Although its title-page promises a
"Full Relation" of Morrell's cheats, <i>Diego Redivivus</i> presents
only the final "will" episode, whereas <i>The Notorious Impostor</i>
ranges over the whole criminal career. Both narratives have in common
the long will and codicil, except that <i>The Notorious Impostor</i>
(p. 34) drastically shortens the Latin passage which, in <i>Diego
Redivivus</i> (p. 10), states that the will had been probated. Even
more conclusive evidence may be found in comparing the dates of the
final events in the two accounts. <i>Diego Redivivus</i>, licensed on
January 12, stops short with the humble burial of Morrell on January
13. Considerably later, certainly, must be the occurrence described in
the Postscript of <i>The Notorious Impostor</i>: the nurse's and
assistants' recollection that Morrell was laughing to himself in his
last grim cheating of the world.
</p>

<p>
Part One of <i>The Notorious Impostor</i>, as the sequel informs us,
met with a "general Reception." Advertised in the February issue of
<i>The Term Catalogues</i>, also, was a separate continuation. Interest
in the impostor did not diminish during February. "The Death of
<i>William M<sup>o</sup>rrell</i>," complained <i>The Gentleman's Journal</i>
of this month, "hath made too much Noise not to have reach'd you before
this.... Had not his Will and Life been printed, I would have given you
a large Account of both." The anonymous writer refers here, perhaps, to
<i>Diego Redivivus</i> ("Will") and <i>The Notorious Impostor</i>
("Life") in the order of their publication. He then ironically lauds,
in the verses of "<i>William Morrell's</i> Epitaph," the great skill
of the impostor ("Columbus-like I a new World descry'd, / Of Roguery
before untry'd").
</p>

<p>
Elkanah Settle's two parts of <i>The Notorious Impostor</i> were
finally published together in 1694 as <i>The Compleat Memoirs of the
Life of that Notorious Impostor Will. Morrell, alias Bowyer, alias
Wickham, &#38;c.</i> &#8230; under the imprint of Abel Roper and E. Wilkinson.
So extensive are the re-arrangements of the episodes taken from Parts
One and Two that <i>The Compleat Memoirs</i> may be regarded as a
fifth, very different narrative. All the apologies for not resorting to
"romance" are now dropped, and the humorous dedication is replaced by a
direct appeal to Gabriel Balam, signed "E. Settle." <i>The Compleat
Memoirs</i> then reworks the texts of the two Parts into a smooth,
chronologically consistent narrative.<a href="#note5" name="noteref5">
<small>[5]</small></a> Even more important in
designating <i>The Compleat Memoirs</i> as "new" are the "Considerable
Additions never before Published" announced by the title-page. After
using the incidents from <i>The Second Part of the Notorious
Impostor</i>, Settle then adds: "Since the first Publication of our
fore-going History of our Grand Guzman, we have receiv'd some Comical
Adventures, worth inserting in his Memoirs, which though they now bring
up the Rear of his Chronicle, however, they were the first of all his
Wedlock Feats...." In the totally new adventures that end <i>The
Compleat Memoirs</i> (pp. 72-88), the cynical tone and raciness of the
picaresque become even more dominant than in the earlier separate
narratives.<a href="#note6" name="noteref6">
<small>[6]</small></a>
</p>

<br>

<p>
The importance of the Morrell narratives in the development of English
fiction lies mainly in their deft combinations of the real and the
picaresque and in their conscious effort to unify the action, draw out
the humour, or handle realistic talk and setting. But the narratives
also look backward to an older type, the picaresque. William Morrell
makes his printed appearance as the new picaro. The title <i>Diego
Redivivus</i> (i.e. James Revived) had overtones of the sensationally
picaresque. The witty pseudonym "Don Diego Puede-Ser" had been used by
James Mabbe in his translation (1623) of Aleman's <i>Vita del Picaro
Guzman</i>;<a href="#note7" name="noteref7">
<small>[7]</small></a> and more recent in English memories were the exploits of
James Hind, the English Rogue. In the Dedication, <i>The Notorious
Impostor</i> describes itself as "<i>the Life of our English</i>
Guzman" and later promises to "paint our new <i>Guzman</i> in some of
his boldest and fairest Colours." But the picaresque traditions have
shaded into one another. For Morrell is not simply the new Guzman; he
is also Hudibras and, in <i>The Second Part</i>, Don Quixote.
</p>

<p>
Still another reason for the importance of the Morrell narratives is
their consciousness of fictional techniques and theory. In <i>Diego
Redivivus</i>, for example, the final deception is meticulously
developed with closely-woven incidents which do not appear elsewhere.
The motives of the characters, too, are sharply defined; and the action
is unified by the two references to oath-taking (pp. 2-3). The
anonymous author, at the outset, stresses the value of "the Particulars
&#8230; no disacceptable Entertainment" (p. 1). Aware of theory, he
specifies that Morrell created "some Romantick narrative" to explain
his poverty (p. 4). In fictional technique, Elkanah Settle approaches a
unified theme especially in <i>The Second Part of the Notorious
Impostor</i> and the "Comical Adventures" of <i>The Compleat
Memoirs</i> where the incidents are mainly of one kind&#8212;matrimonial.
Theorizing appears, too, in Part One somewhat in the manner of Daniel
Defoe: "we dare not venture to play the Historian any farther than
certain Intelligence (which yet we have not received) can guide us,
being resolved not to load our Rambles with Romance or Fiction, his
Life being furnisht with matter sufficiently voluminous without the
addition of Flourish or Fancy" (p. 27). This may be Settle's pointed
reference to the "fiction" of <i>Diego Redivivus</i>.<a href="#note8" name="noteref8">
<small>[8]</small></a> He maintains,
also, that he had to delay for a fortnight the publication of <i>The
Second Part of the Notorious Impostor</i> in order to be certain of its
authenticity.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the importance of the Morrell narratives may be seen in terms
of the realistic fiction that was to achieve fulfillment in the
eighteenth-century novel. The clear presence of fictional elaboration,
in <i>The Notorious Impostor</i>, caught the attention of both Frank
Wadleigh Chandler and Ernest Bernbaum.<a href="#note9" name="noteref9">
<small>[9]</small></a> Elkanah Settle thus rightly
belongs with writers, like Francis Kirkman, who masked fiction as the
truth. Historians of the novel, moreover, attach significance to <i>The
Notorious Impostor</i> in its resemblance to the novels of Defoe, Mrs.
Heywood, and Smollett. Only the claim of influence on Smollett's
<i>Ferdinand Count Fatham</i> has been investigated to any extent. In a
full analysis of Smollett's novel, Chandler's strong statement will
have to be taken into account: "The resemblance, indeed, between the
two anti-heroes and the terms in which the accounts of their cheating
are couched is so strong as to suggest actual borrowing on the part of
Smollett."<a href="#note10" name="noteref10">

    Since writing the above, I have been informed by G. F. Osborn,
    archivist of the City of Westminster Public Libraries, that the

Although <i>Diego Redivivus</i> occasionally resembles <i>The Notorious
Impostor</i>, it need not necessarily be Settle's work. The similar
style and the identical documentation (e.g. the will) may be due to
Settle's direct use of the earlier narrative. None of its
minutely-drawn description, curiously, is perpetuated in <i>The
Compleat Memoirs</i>. The authorship of <i>Diego Redivivus</i> remains
an unsettled question.

<i>William Morrell</i> alias <i>Bowyer</i>, &#38;c.
</p>

<br>
<p class="dropcap">T<span class="dcap">his</span> Famous Rover, from the Multitude of his Titles, to begin with his
right Name <i>William Morrell</i>, was by Profession a Chyrurgion, and
more than twenty Years ago, for many Years together, a Practitioner of
good Credit in <i>Banbury</i>, where his Industry honestly got him, by
his Practice, near two Hundred a Year, with which he maintained
himself, his Wife and Family very handsomely, till about eighteen Years
ago he began to be very Lazy, and much addicted to hanker after the
Conversation of the Gentry thereabouts; and being a Person very
Facetious, and his Company not disacceptable, he screwed himself into
the Society of the best Quality round about, and would be a Month or
two a Guest at several Great Mens Houses; more particularly he some
time since insinuated himself into the Favor of a Worthy Gentleman near
<i>Banbury</i>, viz. <i>Humphry Wickham</i> of <i>Swakely</i> Esq;
whose Person and Character he pretended to represent, and in which
Imposture he made his last <i>Exit</i>.
</p>

<p>
But to begin our History in order; From his Conversing with Gentlemen
and Herding with Quality, Business began to fall off: His many Rambles
from home, soon made his Practice flag; when the Glass and the Bottle
came into play, the Salvatory and Playster-box went out. And his
Patients could not well stay for the Setting of a Broken Limb, or
Tenting a Green Wound, till our <i>Esculapius</i> was to be called, the
Lord knows where, and found the Devil knows when. This Trade
continuing, the other fell to decay, till at last Poverty began to peep
in at his Window, and Duns to hover about his Door. In these little
Exigencies and Necessities (for the Gentleman's Tables abroad would not
fill the Bellies at home, nor would Hunting or Hawking pay Landlords
Rent) his Wants put him upon Shifts and Artifices for his Subsistence;
and what with a Natural Wit and a pretty large Talent of Confidence,
the pressing Hand of Fortune threw him upon several Tricks and Frauds
to hold his Head above-board. But not to trouble you with any of his
lesser Diminutive Exploits, the Infancy and Nonage of his Activity, we
do not think fit to treat you with these pettier Adventures, but e'en
set out in one of his noblest Atchievements, and paint our new
<i>German</i> in some of his boldest and fairest Colours.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly he Equips himself with a Sturdy Young Country Fellow, a
<i>Ralpho</i> to our <i>Hudibras</i>, and takes a Knight-Errantry one
day to a Fair at <i>Brayls</i> in <i>Warwickshire</i>, his Habit
between a Grazier and a plain Country Gentleman; where Santering about
with his Man <i>Tom</i> (for so his Squire was titled) at last spying a
Knot of good likely Kine (near a Score of them). <i>Ah Master</i>, says
Tom, <i>what a parcel of brave Cattle are these</i>. <i>Ay</i> Tom,
replies the Master, <i>I am sorry I saw them no sooner; these would do
my Business to a T; but as the Devil and ill Luck would have it, I have
laid out my whole Stock already, and so I'll e'en set my Heart at
Rest</i>. The Country Fellow, the Owner of the Cattle, seeing a
Gentleman of his honest Appearance surveying his Beasts, and hearing
every word that pass'd between the Man and Master (for they took care
to talk loud enough to be heard) thought he had got a good Chapman, and
desired the Gentleman to draw nearer and handle the Cattle.
<i>Handle</i>, answers <i>Tom, what for?</i> <i>You know, Sir, you have
laid out all your Money already, and what should we handle Cattle
unless we had Cole to buy 'em. I confess they are for your Turn above
any I have zeen in the whole Vair, but that's nothing, the Money Master
the Money.</i> <i>The Money</i>, replies the Country-man, <i>Troth that
shall make no Difference, nor break Squares between us; if you and I
can agree, the Cattle are at your Service: I suppose you are some
honest Gentleman hereabouts, and the Money will do my work next
Market-day. Pray what may I call your Name? My Name is</i> Walters,
replies our Cattle-Merchant, <i>Walters, Master</i>, answers our
Country-man, <i>What any Relation to his Worship the Noble Sir</i>
William Walters? <i>Ay, Friend, a small Relation, a Brother of his. A
Brother of Sir</i> William<i>'s</i>! Off goes the Country-man's Bonnet
at the next word, and a long Scrape made; for no Respect was too great
for a Brother to a Person of such eminent Quality. <i>My Cattle, Noble
Squire, Ay with all my Heart.</i> In short after much ado to make the
Country-man be covered before him, he fell to treat about the Price of
the Cattle, in which he bargained so warily, that they had almost
parted for a single Shilling in a Dispute between them. But at last the
Bargain and Sale concluded, <i>Tom</i> is commanded to drive home the
Cattle, the Money to be paid next Market-day, and the Country-man has
the Honor to drink a Pot at parting with his Worshipful Chapman our Sir
<i>William</i>'s Brother: This Feat performed, he takes a walk round
the Fair, and picks up a pretty Country Girl, a Mason's Daughter, at a
small Town about four Miles off, and gives her the common Country
Civility of a Fair, <i>viz.</i> a Glass of White-wine and Sugar. During
this Entertainment of our young Damsel, he is most desperately smitten
with her Beauty, insomuch that our <i>Inamorato</i> must wait upon her
home to her Father's House, nothing but Death and Despair attending if
he cannot have that extraordinary Happiness. The Girl who by this time
had learnt his Name and Quality, was not a little confounded at the
pressing Importunities of a Person of his Worth to a poor Girl of her
little Capacity, and notwithstanding her modest Refusals, felt a secret
Pride from so kind an offer, and at last accepted of his Service home.
No sooner was she got safe handed home, and Mother and Daddy, were
privately whispered what Honor they received from such a Visitant; the
best the House could afford was not good enough for him: after the
courser Compliments of [<i>Lord, Sir, such a Person of Quality under
our poor Roof</i>] and the like; the best welcome that could be made
him was not wanting: Nay, for what was deficient at home, the whole
Neighborhood was Ransakt to lend help toward the Accommodation. Our new
Lover not to baulk a good Cause, openly Professes no less than
honourable Matrimonial Affection to his dear Conqueror. Estate he wants
none; and Portion or Quality are below his Consideration, the
Satisfaction of Love is the only thing in the World he resolves to
gratifie.
</p>

<p>
The Father and Mother are much astonish'd at such an Addressor to their
Daughter, nor is the Daughter her self a little surprized at it, though
of the two her Wonder is the least; for her Sexes natural Frailty was
so apt to make her think it the pure Effect of her own sweet Face, that
the power of her Charms, and the Quality of her Captive was not
altogether (she fancied) so extraordinary an Adventure. In fine, Our
passionate Admirer pushes on his suit with all the Vigour and
Application imaginable, and truly you may well conceive so weak a
Resistance could not well hold out long against so Puissant an
Assailer: The Siege is press'd home, and in three short days the white
Flag is hung out, a Parly beat, Articles concluded, and the Fort
surrendered. Our Damsel, in short, commits Matrimony; and the whole
Family is not a little Transported at such a Noble Alliance. Thus
Wedded and Bedded, Our new Couple are all Honey and Sweetness, and
though Sir <i>William Walter</i>'s House was not above a dozen Miles
from thence, his Adopted Brother all safe and secure, sleeps in the
soft Arms of his young Bride with all the Rapture of Pleasure and
Delight. After three Revelling days were spent in Feasting and Joy, the
Father-in-Law and himself enter in a close Cabinet Consult about
providing for Family and Settlement. He tells the Old Man, that truly
his Brother the Knight will undoubtedly take no little Dudgeon at this
Match, not that he cares a Farthing for't. He has Married the only
Creature of the World he can Love, and he is resolved to Cherish her
accordingly. But however, to manage Affairs with Discretion, he thinks
it his best Prudence and Policy, to get his Trunks and the Writings of
his Estate safe out of his Brother's Hands, before he publishes the
Marriage. And for that purpose he has no better way than for his
Father-in-Law to help him to a small Cart and a couple of able Horses,
and to drive to his Brothers, and take up his Trunks, <i>&#38;c.</i> And
considering he had laid out all his ready Money in Cattle at
<i>Brayle</i> Fair, he desired the favour of him to furnish him with
Ten Pounds, that he might not be unprovided with a little of the Ready
about him, in case of any Rupture between his Brother and himself, till
he could furnish himself better amongst his Tenants.
</p>

<p>
The Old Man very readily embraced this reasonable proposition, and
though truly the Summ of Ten Pounds was above his Stock, nevertheless
living in Repute amongst his Neighbors, through great Solicitation,
some forty and some thirty Shillings, and such like Summs, with much
ado he raises the Ten Pounds desired; and more and above he procures
two very Able Horses and a Cart to bring away the Treasure aforesaid,
<i>&#38;c.</i>
</p>

<p>
By this time his Man <i>Tom</i> having Sold the Cattle, is come to wish
his Noble Master Joy of his fair Bride, and so the Master and
<i>Tom</i> attended by a Brother of his Bride, an Honest Country Swain,
who though so highly honoured with this new Affinity, is at present
planted in no higher a Post than to be a Mate with his Man <i>Tom</i>
to drive the Cart, set forwards, <i>&#38;c.</i>
</p>

<p>
The Brother-in-Law, Cheek by Jowl, with the fore-Horse of his small
Team, drives on very merrily for about Nine of the Twelve Miles to Sir
<i>William</i>'s, entertaining his Worshipful Relation with the very
best Tune he could Whistle all the way they travell'd.
</p>

<p>
But now within Three Miles of home, our politick Bridegroom thinks it
advisable, that one of his Carters, the Brother, should make a Halt at
an Alehouse where they stopp'd, and the whole Manage of the Cart and
Horses be intrusted with <i>Tom</i>, for fear the sight of a Stranger
to come to take up Goods at his Brother's might give occasion of
Curiosity and Inquiry, whereas <i>Tom</i>, an old Servant in the
Family, with less Suspision and Inspection might do it.
</p>

<p>
These strong Reasons (or indeed weaker would have served turn) were
satisfactory enough, and so the Gentleman Equipping his Brother
<i>Clodpate</i> with a <i>George</i> to stay and Drink till they
returned, the Master and Man fairly drive on, for the remaining three
Miles to bring off the Bag and Baggage, <i>&#38;c.</i>
</p>

<p>
The Potent Summ of a whole Half Crown to be laid out in Ale, set in our
Country Youth to a hearty Carouse with the kind Hostess of the House,
where the Esquires Health was over and over remembred, not forgetting
the Great Man at the Great House about Three Miles off; where, as
simple a Country Fellow as he was, he expected one day to be better
acquainted.
</p>

<p>
But to draw this Adventure towards a Conclusion, our waiting Carter
long expecting the return of the Brother, the Palfries and the Cargo,
notwithstanding the Strength of powerful Ale, and his Sweet Land-Ladies
diverting Company, began at last to be Impatient; sometimes he fancied
the Loading was too heavy for the Poor Beasts, and he thought it his
best way to walk out and see if he could meet them: But all Inquiry was
in vain, Night at last drew on, and the best part of his Half-crown
melted down; at last, though very Uneasie and Restless, he is perswaded
by his kind Hostess to take a hard Nap till Morning. The Cock was not
so soon awake as he, for to tell Truth, he ne're slept at all, though
indeed he dreamt all Night, for he could not think less, than that some
Retainers of the Family had undoubtedly followed the Cart, and Murder'd
the Squire to run away with the Treasure, and what his poor Sister
would suffer to be a Widow so early, was little less than a mortal
Apprehension. Thereupon very betimes in the morning he pads to Sir
<i>William</i>'s, and very earnestly enquires, what was become of the
Squire, the Knights Brother. Sir <i>William</i>'s Brother, <i>reply'd
the Servants</i>, we know none he has; 'tis true, he had one some years
beyond Sea, but whether dead or alive, is more than any Man upon
<i>English</i> Ground (<i>God wott</i>) can tell. How! no
Brother-in-law Squire! No Sir <i>William</i>'s Family! No Sister like
to be a Lady, nor Brother a Gentleman! nor no Horses nor Cart neither!
This staggering Account, put him into so doleful a Dumps, that he stood
almost Thunderstruck. And truly the twelve Miles home agen, was so
tedious a Journey, and the lamentable Narrative he must make 'em at
home, so killing a Fancy, that it was a great Mercy he did not make a
stay upon some convenient Twig in some Hedge in the Road, rather than
live to be the Messenger of such a woful, sad Tale&#8212;But ill News at
last must out. The Bird and the Beasts were all flown; the poor Bride
sweetly brought to Bed, a Cart and two Horses to pay for, a Son-in-law
to find when the Devil was blind, the Daughters sweet play thing lost,
the Father and Mother dipt ten whole pounds in Chalk, and the whole
Family under the suffering of a whole Chamberpot full of waylings and
Tears for their Calamities and Misfortunes.
</p>

<p>
But to return to our Rover: By the sale of Cart and Team, ten pound in
Cole the last lump, and the price of his Kine the other, his Pockets
were pretty well lined; and considering this spot might soon grow too
hot for him, he thinks it wisest to shift the Scene, and thereupon
dismissing, for some time, his Man <i>Tom</i>, who had pretty well
lick'd his Fingers in so profitable a Service, our Grasier now
transmogrifies into a Spark, and very sprucely rigg'd, takes a ramble
Westward, where meeting with no Adventure worth recital, in some small
time he gets to <i>Ludlow</i>. There taking up the first Night at an
Inn, his Garb (though unattended by Servants) soon made him good
Reception; his first enquiry was to learn out the Eminentest People in
the Town, of which being readily inform'd by the Drawers; he learnt,
amongst other Relations, that there was a Substantial Wealthy
Tradesman, had two pretty Marriageable Daughters: Being directed to the
House, he addresses to the Father, telling him he was a
<i>Barkshire</i> Gentleman, and intending to make some small abode in
<i>Ludlow</i>, he did not think fit to continue in a Publick House, but
would gladly gain admission to some private Family. The Tradesman
(whose name we will not mention) being a Widower, and taken with the
manner of his Discourse, kindly invited him to his own House, which our
Travelling Gallant as kindly embracing, Accommodation was made, and he
was lodged that very Night at this private Landlords.
</p>

<p>
His entrance here gave him the opportunity of daily conversing with no
mean wit and charms in the two sweet Daughters of the Family; and our
Gallant, very apt to take fire at but a small matter of Beauty,
especially with a Portion at the Tail of it, felt no little wamblings
at the extraordinary accomplishments of the elder, somewhat the sweeter
Creature. But this new Adventure was not an enterprise so easie as the
last; this Sire of some fashion, was so far above the Education and
Extract of his former Father-in-Law, a Man of Mortar and Trowel; and
his Daughters of a reach and understanding so much beyond the others
humbler capacity; that measures must be quite alter'd here from those
that he took before. Accordingly now his discourse was always upon
Foreign subjects, himself and his own affairs the least part of his
talk; and if any inquisitive question, either by Father or Daughters
were made relating to his Family or Concerns, he answered with that
Modesty, and almost silence to all demands of that kind, that he left
their curiosity still in the dark; and which indeed was so much a
heightning to the favourable imaginations they had conceived of him;
that they doubted not in the least, but he was of eminent Quality; and
what any boasting Vanity would have made 'em rather suspect, his
Modesty on the contrary confirm'd. 'Twas some few days before they
inquired his name, for which he had ready at his Tongue's end, the name
of a very great Family in <i>Barkshire</i>; but not descending to
particulars, the remoteness of the place did not gain 'em much
intelligence of his Quality from only the bare name. All this while, at
some little distance, he dropt a great many complaisant words to the
elder Sister, which look'd very much like Love, and which he indeed
desired should be so interpreted. In this Conversation, now of a
Fortnights continuance, he had rendred himself so acceptable to the
whole Family, that a great many favourable thoughts on all sides
inclined towards him. The Address to the Daughter, at last looked a
little more plain and barefac'd, and at that time a Fair happening at
<i>Ludlow</i>, where he had been diverting himself with seeing of
Fashions, he came home in much Concern, and some kind of Passion, much
greater than hitherto they had at any time seen from him. "Certainly
there is no place in the world (<i>says he passionately</i>) so
retir'd, but some Devil or other will still find out and haunt me." The
odness of this expression invited the elder Sister to ask him what he
meant. "Why truly, Madam, (<i>he replied</i>) I have been hunted from
three or four Towns already, for in spight of all my resolutions of
living <i>incognito</i>, some unlucky Person or other comes full in my
mouth, and will betray me in spight of my Soul." This answer did but
heighten her Curiosity, and having, as she thought, some little
Interest in him as a profest Servant of hers, she was a little the
bolder in pressing the Question; and therefore plainly ask'd him why he
liv'd <i>incognito</i>, and what accident had now discovered him: To
this at last, with a little more frankness than he had hitherto used,
he replied, the reason of his Ramble from his Family, with his Living
three or four Months past unknown to the whole World, was only to
prevent the ruine of a Sister, who like a foolish Girl, was in much
danger to be undone by a Beggerly Match she was too fond of; and her
Portion being in his hands, he had absented himself from his home, left
the softness of her tears, the importunities of several Advocate's in
behalf of this indigent Lover, together with the weakness of his own
tender heart, might at last be prevail'd upon to grant his consent to
what he knew would be his shame and her undoing. And as ill luck would
have it, he had unfortunately tumbled upon a Countryman of his, now at
the Fair, who would infallibly run open mouth'd to his Sister and his
Family, and tell 'em all where he was. This discovery gave a good
occasion to the fair Examiner to be not only a Pleader for her own Sex
in the Person and cause of his unknown Sister, but likewise to be a
Champion for Love. For now she plainly told him, that a great many
grains of allowance were to be made, where hearts were inseparable. If
this Lover of his Sisters was a man of Sense and Quality (as neither of
those he could deny him) it was a little barbarous in him to oppose the
whole Repose and Contentment of so near a Relation as a Sister, for so
sordid a consideration as a little Worldly Interest. Besides, there was
a Providence always attended Faith and Truth in Love, and undoubtedly
sooner or later would provide for their well-being, or else enable 'em
to bear a meaner portion of Riches, which others perhaps might, less
contentedly, possess. This argument was almost the daily discourse, in
which she seem'd to gain some little ground, but not enough to perswade
him to the unreasonable Grant of his Sisters desires.
</p>

<p>
About five days after comes a Letter directed to him at <i>Ludlow</i>,
with the Post Mark upon it very authentically, which in a very legible
Woman's hand contained these words.
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
    Dear Brother,
</p>

    <p class="dropcap">W<i><span class="dcap">h</span>at unhappy Star am I born under, to suffer all this miserable
    Persecution? Certainly, when my Father left me to your disposal,
    and tied my Portion to your liking of the man that must marry me,
    surely he could never have died reconciled to Heaven, could he have
    foreseen the Slavery he tied his poor Child to, in putting me into
    the power of so cruel a Brother. To run so many Months from your
    House, your Family, nay, your Honour too, (for what must the
    censuring world talk of you) and all to break a poor Sister's
    Heart. Oh shameful! to hide your self from the World, and run from
    Mankind, only to shut your Ears against Justice, and to be deaf to
    all Goodness and Humanity! Alas, what Capital Crime have I
    committed, who only loved a Gentleman, in Birth and Blood no ways
    my Inferiour; and what if an unfortunate Younger Brother's slender
    Patrimony of a Hundred a Year, is not answerable to a Portion of
    Two thousand Pounds. A wonderful Cause to make me the most unhappy
    Creature living, in refusing me the only Blessing the World has to
    give. How many fair steps to Preferment and Honour lye in the way
    of so accomplish'd and so well Related a Gentleman, notwithstanding
    his Elder Brother run away with the Estate; and what good Fortune
    have I not to hope for, if your Barbarous Aversion did not
    interpose between my Felicity and me. In short, resolve to return
    home, and be kind to your languishing, and almost despairing
    Sister, or else expect very speedily to be visited by her at your
    Bedside in her Winding-sheet. For if Ghosts can walk, and your
    Barbarity has sworn my Death, expect to be eternally haunted, as
    you shall deserve from&#8212;&#8212;</i>

<p class="sig">
    Your Distracted&#8212;&#8212;

</div>

<p>
The next Post four or five Letters more came after him; one from his
Bayliff, to desire him, for God's sake to come home again; for the
Devil a Farthing would his Tenants pay till they saw their Landlord. A
second from one of his Tenants, complaining of his bad Crop, and the
low price of Corn, and that unless he would bate him Twenty pound a
Year Rent, he could never hold his Farm; earnestly desiring his Worship
to come home, and take care of his poor Tenants, <i>&#38;c.</i> A third
condoling his Misfortune in the loss of his Eldest Son, and desiring to
see his Sweet Worship's Face, that he might get him to put his Second
Boy's Life into his Copy-hold; and others of the like Import.
</p>

<p>
These Letters our Spark left in his Closet Window, and one whole day
going abroad, by a pretended Negligence, he shot the Bolt of his Closet
Lock out of the Staple, and so left his Door a-jar, and his Letters
expos'd to any body that would please to read 'em. This Stratagem
succeeded to his Wish, for the Daughter, whom I may now call his
Mistress, knowing him safe abroad, had dropt into his Chamber when the
Maid was making the Bed, and finding the Closet Door open, made bold to
peep, and spying his Letters there, tips the wink upon the Maid, whom
she made of the Council, and read 'em all out. The Contents put her
mightily upon the gog; for certainly she concluded he must be a Man of
a mighty Estate, so many Tenants, and the Lord knows what; and if a
Sister had Two thousand Pounds, what must an Elder Brother possess.
After she had conjured the Maid to silence, she could not forbear
running to her Father, and telling him all she had discover'd: The
Father at first a little reprimanded her Curiosity, but considering he
had found out a Love Intrigue between his Daughter and him, he thought
it no unwelcome discovery. At last looking very stedfastly upon his
Daughter's Face, with a sort of a kind fatherly leer, he cry'd, <i>Ah
Child, would he were a Bed with thee</i>. How, Father, <i>reply'd the
Girl blushing</i>. Nay no harm (<i>quoth the Father</i>) Chicken,
that's all. Thou sayst he makes love to thee, and troth I must own it
no small part of my Ambition to have a Person of his Quality and
Fortunes for a Son-in-law. In short, The Father gave her very
seasonable Admonition; for having sounded her Inclinations, and found
'em to his own wish, with a Fatherly Authority he commanded her, if his
Addresses hinted at Marriage, to make him all reasonable Advances that
way.
</p>

<p>
Our Gallant found his Plot had taken; for he had critically observed in
what most particular manner and station to a quarter of an inch he had
laid his Letters; and finding all of 'em displaced more or less from
the exact point he had left 'em, he plainly perceived they had all of
'em been read. Besides, in compliance to her Father's Orders, and
indeed a little to her own Inclinations, he discover'd her usual
Coldness to him a little diminish'd, and her Aspect more favourable,
which plainly told him the Bait had taken. Whereupon one Evening
finding her alone in her Garden, with a confidence more than usual, he
plainly spoke home, telling her what an inestimable Blessing he should
acquire in possessing so much sweetness for a Wife.
</p>

<p>
A long Courtship ensued, the Particulars too tedious, only the Girl was
a little more pliant than ordinary, but much doubting the integrity of
his Protestations; alledging it was very unlikely he would debase
himself to marry a Creature of her mean Fortune, for all she could at
present challenge, except what her Father might do for her after his
decease, was only a 100<i>l.</i> left her in her Father's hands by an
Uncle deceas'd. Our Gallant presently with much disdain seem'd to
slight all thoughts of her Fortune, for that, he thank'd Heav'n, he
wanted not; and truly her dear Person was the only consideration that
had fix'd his Heart intirely her Captive. To bring him to the happy
point, 48 hours are not past, before he comes to reap the fair Fruit.
The marriage-knot is tied; and the Nuptials consummated, and Joy and
Felicity runs high between them.
</p>

<p>
In this happy State, and uninterrupted Delights, they continued some
days, when of a sudden his old Servant, <i>Tom</i>, booted and spurr'd,
comes to <i>Ludlow</i>, and now in a little higher station than before,
in the garb and figure of one of his Bayliffs, he comes post thus far,
first to tell him the Distraction of his Family occasion'd by his
absense; 2dly, The Lady his Sister's sudden departure, God knows
whither, for she went away by night two days before he set out from
home, and has not been heard of since. And that a Letter was come from
<i>Bristol</i>, intimating that his Venture in <i>Sherry</i> was safely
landed there, and that the King's Customs came to 97<i>l.</i> but his
Correspondent at <i>Bristol</i> being lately dead, the Custom was yet
unsatisfied; and truly for his part none of the Tenants would pay him
one Groat till they saw their Landlord again, and therefore he could
not raise the Money to satisfy it. Our new Bridegroom hearing all this,
presently communicates the whole matter to his sweet Bedfellow,
desiring her to get her Father to accommodate him with that Sum; not
that he ask'd it as any part of her Unkle's Legacy, he scorned to be so
poor-spirited; no, he requested it as a Boon, and the Monies should
speedily be repaid with Thanks: Which if he pleas'd to do for him, his
Servant should fall down the <i>Severn</i>, and take care of his Wines,
of which his dear Father-in-law should have one Hogshead to drink to
her <i>Hans in Keldar</i>. The Daughter was a speedy and successful
Embassadress, for the Money was presently laid him down in Gold, for
the more ease of his Servant's carriage of it. <i>Tom</i> had not been
two hours gone, but a Footboy in a very fine Livery brings him a Letter
from his Sister, signifying her extreme Concern for his deserting his
Affairs and Family, and that her Griefs and Disquiets had made her take
a long Ramble to see him once more. And that she was now at
<i>Hereford</i>, not daring to approach any nearer till she had his
gracious Warrant and Permission, which she humbly upon her bended Knees
intreated of him, with a great deal more passionate Courtship to him
upon that Subject. Upon perusal of this Letter he seem'd to melt into a
great deal of good nature and compassion for his dear Sister, insomuch
that a Tear stood in his Eyes which his sweet Bride very kindly drank
in a kiss. At length launching out into a great many tender Expressions
towards his Sister, which Goodness his kind Bride much applauded and
encouraged, throwing in many a kind word in her Sisters behalf; At last
the Brother concluded he would be so civil to her, that since her
extravagant Affection had brought her thus far to visit him, he would
return her the Favour of Riding himself to <i>Hereford</i> to fetch
her, if his kind Father would procure him a Horse. Ay, with all his
heart. Nay, both Father and Daughter proffer'd to take the same Journey
with him to pay their Respects to the young Lady, and attend upon her
as part of her Train to <i>Ludlow</i>. No, by no means, replied our
Spark; that was more than the Rules of Honour would allow: for his dear
Bride, as his Wife, was a Person in Quality above her, and whatever
Kindnesses she pleased to show her when at <i>Ludlow</i>, was in her
free Power; but this complaisance was too great a Condescension, and
consequently he beg'd her leave that the tenderness he had of her
Honour might absolutely forbid her any such thought. And indeed his
Father's was much the same Condescention, which he must likewise no way
suffer.
</p>

<p>
The Father and Daughter both silenced with this Answer, acquiesced with
his Reasons, as being much a more experienced Master of Ceremonies than
they could pretend to; consenting to let him go alone only attended by
the Sister's Page; in the mean while resolving to apply their officious
Respects to this fair, tho yet unknown Relation another way,
<i>viz.</i> in making a suitable preparation for her honourable
Reception. But first a very stately Horse was borrow'd, one that a
Collonel of the Guards had lately bid a lumping Sum for; with all
Accoutrements answerable. And at mounting, our Cavalier whispering in
his Father's ear, and telling him he had been long from home, and not
knowing whether his remaining Stock might hold out to his present
Occasions, he desired&#8212;&#8212; The Father would not hear out the Speech, but
running up stairs presently, fetch'd down, and stole into his hand a
silk Purse richly lined with Twenty Broad Pieces.
</p>

<p>
Our Squire thus every way obliged, after his due Conges all made, bids
them all Farewel till tomorrow, and so prances off. Here let us leave
the Father and Daughter as busy for the Credit of the Cause, as may be
imagined, making all suitable Provision for tomorrow's Entertainment;
the Kitchin, and Pantry, the Bed-Chamber, and the Court-Cubboard, must
all appear in Splendour extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
And now to return to our Traveller: Heaven knows he had the misfortune
to miss his way, for he never found <i>Hereford</i>, nor Sister. His
Barb too found another Chapman than the Collonel of the Guards; for
both Horse and Accoutrements all embargoed, and the dismounted Cavalier
slipt into a Frize-Coat of his Man <i>Tom's</i> providing, who waited
his coming, The Master, Page, and <i>Tom</i>, in a small prepared
Vessel, troul'd down the <i>Severn</i> as fast as Tide and good Speed
could carry them.
</p>

<p>
As we thunder'd down the <i>Severn</i>, one of our Strollers being at
present useless, our Page (well rewarded for playing his part in the
<i>Farse</i>) is dropt at <i>Worcester</i>, from whence we continue our
Voyage to <i>Bristol</i>. Arrived there pretty late in a Summers
Evening, 'tis not thought convenient to appear in any Dress whatever
had been seen before at <i>Ludlow</i>, nor indeed to expose his Face,
lest any Inquiry might be made there about him as a Sherry-Merchant,
and so trunking up all his best Rayment, he gets himself new rigged at
a Salesman's in a genteel Garb, but something modester than his
<i>Ludlow</i> Bravery, and <i>Tom</i> and he next morning move off to
<i>Bath</i>.
</p>

<p>
It fortunes here, that he Quarters at one of the great Inns, it being
the beginning of the Summer, just before <i>Bath</i> time, where was a
brisk Daughter of the house, about half way stage between 20 and 30.
and consequently much inclinable manwards. A Girl that had had the
Honour of many a slap cross the Mouth, and chuck under the Chin by
Lords and Earls in her time, her Fathers honourable Guests at
<i>Bath</i> season. Our most constant Lover of every new face, feels
the old Itch again. Business he finds will thicken upon him, and
therefore flusht with his late Successes, he resolves to throw out his
winning hand as far as it will run.
</p>

<p>
But now to know what Portion this Damsel had, for without a spill of
yellow Boys, naked White and Red has but indifferent Charms with him.
This Intelligence was quickly made, without asking the question; for
there was a Jest in the Family of one of the Drawers being Suitor
there, who belike wanted a tite sum of 80<i>l.</i> to set up withal (a
small Portion of hers formerly left her by a Grandfather, and now at
use.) This Drawer forsooth was a Rival, but not an over-formidable one.
For truly our Inn-keepers Daughter had so often been tickled with the
Addresses of Quality, that (<i>Foh!</i>) her Fathers Drawer was scarce
worthy to hold up her Train. A Gentleman, or nothing for her. Nay, if
she has not the happiness to strike in for a Lease for Life at Bed and
Board with some honourable Person, rather than dye in ignorance, keep a
stale Maiden-head, and so lead Apes, she has long since resolved not to
stand out at a lower game, and en'e admit a Tenant at Will to an Inmate
of Fashion and Quality; and was grosly suspected she had tried the
Constitution of her Body, under a load of Honour long before her
present year of twenty five. But true or false, that's a small Blot, in
her Scutchion.
</p>

<p>
Our <i>Don John</i> is absolutely captivated, and plies her home with
all the Rhetorick that Love can afford. Our man <i>Tom</i> in the
meanwhile but very modestly, is whispering amongst his Mates, the lower
Tire of the Family, the Servants, what a Worthy Gentleman his Master
is, being a Rich <i>Norfolk</i> Gentleman (a pretty large stride from
<i>Bathe</i>) of 500 a year. This Narrative passes pretty well amongst
the shallower pates, the Chamberlain, the Tapster, the Hostler, and the
rest of the inferior Domesticks; but our hardfaith'd young Mistress of
the house, whither bit before, or naturally not over-credulous, does as
good as declare, That her Principles are to look before she leaps. Our
<i>Norfolk</i> Suitor finds his Addresses very acceptable, but still
with a reserve, Provided he be the Man he appears. He plainly sees,
that the Girl, upon good Grounds is very pliable, but she's a little
past the years of being dandled and kist out of her Reason: He or any
man else (any Tooth good Barber) with Honour and Estate may go far with
her; but Demonstration is the only Argument that must carry her Cause.
As many years as she has lived (or at least past for) a Maid, she is
not so hard set, but she can tarry till Substantial Testimony (as far
off as <i>Norfolk</i> lies) can make out the Lands and Tenements,
before she consents to an Inclosure. Our Spark therefore put to his
last Trumps, finds this last a craggier and more difficult Enterprize
than any he had ever yet encountred; however, thinking it a very great
scandal to his Wit, to lie down before her, and shamefully for want of
Ammunition, be forced to raise the Siege, he sets all his Brains at
work for one last Mine to blow her up; or if that take not, he is
resolved to quit the Field. In a day or two after, he begins to be
Melancholly and indisposed; during this fit, he is very cold in his
Love, and applies him to Religious Books, talks much of very odd Dreams
he has had, till at last he takes his Bed. Physitians are sent for,
whether they found any real indications of sickness or no, or
acquiesced to his own Declaration of the Pains he felt, no Medicinal
Application was wanting. His Distemper increasing, he desires a Man of
Law to be sent for, accordingly a Scrivener of the Town is called, who
draws up his Will, in which he gives away about Three Thousand pounds
in several Legacies, leaving his Nephew his full and sole Executor. The
Will is sealed up, and delivered to his Man <i>Tom</i>; and all the
cognizance taken of his Mistress, is only 10<i>l.</i> to buy her
Mourning. Next a Man of God is sent for, and all the necessary
preparations for a Man of another World are made. His Conscience
setled, and his Viaticum for his long Journey most devoutly furnisht.
But it pleases Fate, or the Sick man rather, in some few days after, to
give some small symptoms of amendment, and to shorten the matter, in
Eight or Ten days time he is pretty well recovered, and the next talk
is of fancying his own Native <i>Norfolk</i> Air for perfecting his
Health; all this while the young Damsel, who, tho not call'd to the
Will-making, knew all the Contents of it, and finding from all hands,
the great uprightness and devotion of her humble Servant, could not
fancy that so much Religion and Piety could be an Impostor, and
therefore she doubted not in the least, but the Estate in
<i>Norfolk</i> was unquestionable; and tho indeed her Prudence would
still incline her to a full inquiry and satisfactory account, yet 'tis
now too late, her cooling Admirer talks of speeding to <i>London</i>;
and tho he professes he will leave his heart behind with her, She is
afraid that new Faces and better Fortunes will soon shake her hold
there, and therefore taking her Pillow upon the business, she resolves
not to slip so favourable an opportunity, but to lay hold of the
forelock, and take a good offer whilst she may have it: For with all
her natural Pride, she considers her self but the Lees of a Tap; and
'tis not every Rich Gudgeon will bite at a Bait so blown, and so stale.
</p>

<p>
Her departing Lover still pressing for his Journey, the good-natur'd
Girl watches the next amorous sally of her Gallant, and takes him at
his word, and without asking advice, thinks her own wit sufficient, and
in two days time enters into <i>for better, for worse</i>. The
Town-Bells soon rung All Joy; and the best Hogshead in Daddy's Cellar
run <i>Claret</i>. His Honourable Guest and Son-in-Law was the little
Idol of all the Virgins of the Town, and the envied preferment of sweet
Mrs. <i>Betty</i> had fill'd all Tongues; and scarce a Prayer offered
up for a Husband, but Mrs. <i>Betty</i>'s felicity was made the Pattern
of their Devotion.
</p>

<p>
But now, as the Devil would have it, our dignified Bride is for having
her Dear Spouse, by all means, doing her and her Father the honour of
staying out the whole Bathe Season (now coming on) amongst 'em, and
nothing can divert her from that resolution. This is a very unwelcome
proposal; for the multitude of Faces from all quarters of the Kingdom,
may not only be very dangerous to his circumstances, but likewise his
<i>Norfolk</i> Abilities, long before that time, may be examin'd too
narrowly; and therefore not being able to make any harsh refusal of his
fair Brides request, lest it should look like design, and to marry a
young Girl, and be ashamed of her parentage, would appear so unkind,
that he has no Artifice to wean her from <i>Bathe</i>, and drill her
out of Town, but by pretending a small relapse of his Indisposition,
which he acted so well, that he denied himself the very pleasures of
Love, and fell off even from Family-Duties. This Curtain-failure began
to moderate her passion for staying at <i>Bathe</i>, for her tame
Bedfellow still preaching up the virtues of his own Native
<i>Norfolk</i> Air, his poor defeated Bride could not but have a
womanly longing for so necessary a Restorative, and thereupon for so
important a Medicine to her feeble Yokemate, she consented to go along
with him.
</p>

<p>
All her fine Cloaths were Boxed up, together with several Bed and
Table-Linnen, <i>&#38;c.</i> (for she had pretty good Moveables, all the
Legacies of Deceased Aunts and Grannies, and other good Kin) and all
sent by her Man <i>Tom</i> to the Carriers, and two days after places
took in the flying Coach for their speeding to <i>London</i>.
</p>

<p>
But one main thing was almost forgotten. She had call'd in her Portion,
which for a Guinies Gratification the Scrivener had ready at an Hours
warning, having at that time some other peoples Money by him
undisposed, and hers being out upon Mortgage, the Owners were very well
pleas'd to make an Exchange upon the same security. This Money was not
to be trusted by the Waggon, but to be carryed up with her in the Coach
box, for which her Man <i>Tom</i> beg'd her acceptance of a little Gilt
leather'd Trunk that happen'd to be just small enough to go into the
Coach-box. The Day of setting out being the Morrow, her thoughtful
Spouse had nicely consider'd that the Coach would be in <i>London</i>
half a day before the Carrier, which for some Reasons you'll find in
the sequel was not altogether for his convenience, and therefore he
made a shift to put off the Journey till next Coach-day.
</p>

<p>
Against that time the Gilt-leather'd Trunk, and the Key to it was
deliver'd her, (tho by the by he had got two Keys) and the 80<i>l.</i>
some Broad pieces, a Caudle-Cup, half a dozen of Silver Spoons, and
some other Toys were all stowed in it; and the Kind Couple are
trundling away for <i>London</i>, with the Man well mounted riding by.
</p>

<p>
Now as a Man of his Estate, he had freely given her all her own
Portion, a small Privy Purse to buy her Pins with, having Marryed her
only for Beauty, and much disdaining the addition of so small a sum to
his plentiful Fortune. The first stage being done (for they had but one
Night to lye by the way) the small Cabinet of Treasure was carefully
taken out of the Coach, and lodged in a Closet in the Chamber, and next
Morning deliver'd to <i>Tom</i> to see safely laid in the Coach-box as
before.
</p>

<p>
The next Night arriving both at <i>London</i>, (whither <i>Tom</i>
about <i>Brenford</i> was commanded by his Master to speed a little
before to prepare for their Reception) a very fair Lodging near St.
<i>James</i>'s was ready to entertain her, but no <i>Tom</i> had been
there; and coming to open the Trunk, instead of the Gold and Silver
Entrayls there was nothing but a Bag of Stones, and a piece of a
Brickbat to supply their places, enclosed in a few Rags that stuft up
the Trunk. This amazing sight threw the poor Lady into a most violent
Distraction, and 'twas very hard to hold her from falling into a Fit,
her Husband seeming as much amazed as her self, and joining in the
complaint as loud as she. But to abate her Rage, he told her the wicked
Rogue should not so scape, he had very sufficient security from able
Friends for his honest and faithful service, and their Purses should
make her Reparation, till when the Loss should be made up out of his
own Pocket. Nor would he sleep till he had made her some farther
satisfaction, and therefore beg'd her Excuse but for one half Hour till
he took Coach, and made that search and quest that perhaps would bring
her some considerable Light into the Villany. Her Zeal for her Loss
never look'd any farther, and accordingly well pleas'd with the Kind
Motion, she took leave of him for the half Hour aforesaid.
</p>

<p>
But, alas, a long half Hour, for half the Evening, nay the whole Night
was gone, and neither Man nor Master to be heard of. So Husband and
Portion all departed, she thought fit to secure her Goods and Cloaths
at the Carriers, but the same Calamity attended there likewise, for
<i>Tom</i> had been there too, and swept all.
</p>

<p>
To describe the Distress and Anguish of our present Female Sufferer, or
either of her two foregoing Sisters in Affliction, being a work beyond
our power, we shall e'ne do as the Painter did of old, that is, draw a
Vail before the Face of sorrow, the Lineaments of true Grief being
above the Pen or Pencils skill.
</p>

<p>
And now to follow our Libertine through all his Rambles and Exploits in
this wide Town of <i>London</i>, (for there lyes his next Scene) being
matter we have not yet fully been inform'd in, we dare not venture to
play the Historian any farther than certain Intelligence (which yet we
have not received) can guide us, being resolved not to load our Rambles
with Romance or Fiction, his Life being furnisht with matter
sufficiently voluminous without the addition of Flourish or Fancy.
</p>

<p>
Let it suffice that some time after all these three successive
Adventures, the poor <i>Ludlow</i> VVife comes up to <i>London</i>,
being the last place she has to make her quest after this Impostor and
Monster, for those are the gentlest Names her Sufferings and
Resentments can give him. She has a great Opinion that <i>Newgate</i>
or <i>Newgate</i> Roll, or some other such Chronicles of his Renown
will give her some light into his Life and Fortune, and perhaps the
Justice of Heaven afford her a sight of him at least, if not a power to
execute Heavens and her just Vengeance on so egregious a Reprobate.
</p>

<p>
Her Inn being at <i>Holborn</i> Bridge, she lights into the Company of
a good Motherly VVoman just come from <i>Oxfordshire</i>; the sorrow in
so young a Face, and the swoln Eyes which were not yet dryed, the
Fountain being indeed inexhaustible, the Curiosity of the Elder
Traveller made bold to ask her the cause of so doleful a look, &#38;c. The
young one (who now had no Reserves) plainly told her whole sufferings,
to which the Matron replyed, Alas young VVoman, what are your griefs to
mine? I have been many years the VVife of the most Infamous Miscreant
that the Earth ever bore; deserted and abandoned by the wickedest of
Men, after long years of Honest and Loyal Fidelity to his Bed, and
exposed to perish (which you, thanks to able Friends, need not fear)
<i>&#38;c.</i> with a great deal more bitter Invectives against him. Till
at last upon further conferring of Notes, and describing of Characters
and Persons they came to jump together, and found 'emselves both abused
by the very same Monster, the eldest being indeed his old
<i>Banbury</i> Wife. What Amazement this Accident produced may easily
be conjectured, it will be enough to tell you that the Anguish of both
their Souls, and the Bitterness of Gall on each side made 'em Swear an
inviolable Friendship, determining to search (if possible) the whole
World, to hunt down this Devil. Accordingly they take a Lodging a
little higher in <i>Holborn</i>, where making no secret of both their
hard cases, they open their whole Souls to their new Landlady to engage
her assistance in the Quarrel. The Landlady Transported at both their
Narrations fell upon her Knees, and blest God he had sent 'em to her
House, for this <i>Lucifer</i> they had described, was certainly the
very Man that next Week was to Marry her Daughter. This surprize put
'em all into new Confusion, and the Daughter being called to the
Council, it was evident that this very Fellow had made Love to the
Daughter of the House, the day of Marriage concluded, the Ring and
Wedding Cloaths preparing, &#38;c. This last Deliverance made the poor old
Woman, and the Daughter no less, melt into Tears at this happy
Discovery.
</p>

<p>
Well, 'tis agreed between 'em all, that they shall not stir till he
comes thither, which will be in twenty four Hours at most; and all
their united Vengeance, Constables, Warrants, and what not, shall be
prepar'd for his Reception.
</p>

<p>
This Resolution was heartily fix'd amongst 'em; only the <i>Banbury</i>
Wife would that Evening take a walk to a Cozens, a Citizen, where she
had some important Affairs, but nothing should stay her abroad above an
Hour; she had not walk'd half a Furlong but Destiny or some other
ruling Power threw her full in the Mouth of her Husband; her Passion at
sight of him rose so high, that at first it could not find vent for
words, which he perceiving desired her to walk into a Tavern which was
just before 'em, and there recover her Confusion. You may conceive she
was very ready to accept the Invitation, her Stomach being so full,
that 'twas the only thing she wanted to have her full swing at him. The
Discourse of her part you may well guess at; but his Answer was so
tender, and his Confession so open, that at last she grew patient
enough to hear him out. He plainly told her all he had done, or at
least the greatest part: that it was only the Effects of his Wants and
Necessities, that now he had rais'd enough to re-establish him in the
World, that the Hony Moon of Love had been almost over between them,
and that if he had made any Lapse in Disloyalty to her Marriage Right,
it was not Infidelity but Interest that had enforced him to all. And so
showing her handfuls of Gold and Silver, he humbly intreated a
Reconciliation betwixt 'em. Which good Words and Address at last so
perfectedly obtained, that he perswaded her to send for all her
Houshold Goods, and to live with him somewhere in the Liberties of
<i>Westminster</i>, where disguising his Name, and amending his Faults,
he doubted not through his practice to recover a plentiful Being, and
maintain her like a Woman.
</p>

<p>
The poor Creature absolutely mollified, promises Fidelity to him, and
never returning to her new Lodgings, takes him along with her,
defeating the whole Vengeance that was hatching against him, and not
stirring from him till all her Goods were come up from <i>Banbury</i>,
and a new House furnisht with 'em. She had not lived there three days,
till finding a Gossiping Errand for her to keep her from home a whole
day, at her Return at Night to Bed, she finds neither Husband nor
Goods, Bed to lye, or Stool to sit upon; the whole House being utterly
dismantled, and nothing but nakedness and empty Walls to receive her.
</p>

<p>
This last Cruelty of her Barbarian made her almost run stark Mad, and
returning to her <i>Holborn</i> Lodging to own her frailty in believing
an Infidel, and the Just Judgment that had befaln her upon it, she
found the poor <i>Ludlow</i> Mourner departed, and all her Relief left
was to return to <i>Banbury</i> to live upon the Alms of the Parish.
</p>

<p>
This Libertine Life of our Renegade did not long continue till found at
last by the <i>Ludlow</i> Wife he was thrown into <i>Worcester</i>
Jail; from thence by <i>Habeas Corpus</i> (at the Charge of a Parson in
<i>Southwark</i> whose Daughter he had likewise Married) removed to
<i>Newgate</i>, &#38; upon an Indictment of six Wives appearing against
him, being then Tryed by the Name of <i>Morrel</i> alias <i>Bowyer</i>
(a Name of a Worthy Person of Quality, for personating of whom he had
stood in the Pillory) he pleaded Guilty to those six and twelve more,
and thereby received only the punishment of a Squeeze in the Fist.
</p>

<p>
After this Escape of a Halter, what his following Adventures have been
we are not informed: 'tis to be believed his Will was no ways wanting,
though his power of managing such hardy Exploits might undoubtedly be a
little retrencht: and therefore we have reason to conclude he fell into
smaller Games, in which his Walks have lain something more obscure, and
thereupon by reason of our unacquaintance with the Truth of that part
of his Life, we shall over-leap some years, and bring him to his
Conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Some few days before <i>Christmas</i> he came to one Mr. <i>Cullens</i>
a Baker in the <i>Strand</i> to seek him a Lodging, his Habit but
indifferent, and his Stock not above Two Shillings, pretending himself
to be a Person of Worth and Honour, <i>viz. Humphrey Wickham</i> of
<i>Swaclift</i> in the County of <i>Oxon</i> Esq; a Person whose Name
and Reputation was well known to Mrs. <i>Cullen</i>, being Born not far
from him, which contributed much to the swallowing of the Imposture.
His pretence for leaving his Family in the Countrey, and living here
<i>Incognito</i> was occasion'd (he said) to avoid the payment of
500<i>l.</i> which he stood engaged for, and for which the principal
had left him in the lurch; and which he had made a rash Vow he would
not pay.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <i>Cullen</i>'s Family thus imposed upon supplied all his wants,
and paid him the due Respects to the Quality he Personated, till
falling sick, on the 28th of <i>December</i> he made a Will, as
follows.
</p>

<br>
<p class="ctr">
His WILL.

    This stupendious confidence of a dying man is very amazing, nay he
    drove on the Masquerade at that strange rate, that he may be truly
    said to have ended as he began, having received the blessed
    Sacrament, pretended the settlement of his Conscience, and making
    peace with Heaven with that seeming sincerity, as if he had
    resolved to prevaricate with God with the same assurance he had all
    along done with Mankind. The credulity of these deluded persons his
    Landlord, and the rest, is not much to be wonder'd at, when the
    last Gasps of Death could carry so fair an Hypocrisie, and their
    Transports for his extravagant Legacies bequeathed 'em are rather
    to be pittied then rediculed. And if they have been faulty in any
    little over-fondness of their imaginary good fortune, the Jests and
    Gibes they have received, have been their sufficient punishment;
    besides Mr. <i>Cullin's</i> being run out of above 30<i>l.</i>
</p>

<p>
    After his Death care was taken to provide him a Coffin of about
    10<i>l.</i> value, and the Embalmers were paid for some of their
    Office of preserving him sweet, till preparations for a solemn and
    sumptuous Funeral could be made, suitable to the remains of the
    honourable Deceased. And this Letter was sent as follows.
</p>

    I think it may not be amiss that you keep this private, lest any

</p>
</div>

<p>
In answer to this Letter came a Gentleman from <i>Oxford</i> to tell
Mr. <i>Cullin</i>, that the Christian name of this Mr. <i>Wickham</i>
of <i>Gazington</i> was mistaken, which gave the first Alarm of an
Imposture, otherwise Horse and Mourning had been provided to have
carried him down to <i>Swackley</i> for his Interment there.
</p>

<p>
Mr. <i>Cullin</i> being not over apt to believe himself cheated, but
more to satisfie the rest of the World, sent down a Messenger to
<i>Swackley</i>, with fifteen shillings in his Pocket, mounted upon a
poor Hackney, but ordered to return upon the Bright Bay Gelding
bequeathed him in his Will; being not convinced of the Delusion till
his Messengers Return notwithstanding several persons of Reputation had
declared him a counterfeit; &#38; Major <i>Richardson</i> and Mr.
<i>Compton</i> had both inspected the Corps, and averred him to be the
very man formerly Judged for six Wives as before mentioned, and more
than once their Prisoner in Newgate.
</p>

<p>
The Messenger returning <i>Tuesday</i> the 12th of <i>January</i> he
brought a Compliment to the Executors from Captain <i>Wickham</i>, (who
had treated the Messenger very civilly,) to this effect; that he gave
'em his hearty thanks for their intended kindness to him, and if they
would please to come to <i>Swackley</i> for a Month or more they should
be very welcome, and have the use of all the Geldings, <i>viz.</i> the
Black, the Bright Bay, and Dapple Grey, tho he could not well part with
'em for good and all.
</p>

<p>
Upon this full satisfaction received, about three the next Morning with
no more than a Watchman and a Lanthorn in a Coffin of four shillings
price, he was laid in Earth in a Nook of St. <i>Clements</i>
Churchyard.

    Humphrey Wickham <i>Esq</i>; <i>alias</i> William Morrel,
    <i>alias</i> Bowyer, <i>&#38;c. with Annotations thereupon</i>.
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
T<span class="dcap">he</span> Publick undoubtedly cannot be better entertained, than by the
following Relation, of one of the most notorious Cheats as has been
known in an Age, which has already made a very amazing Noise in the
Town and the Particulars whereof, may be no disacceptable
Entertainment.
</p>

<p>
A Person not over-well Clad, was seen standing gazing about him in the
Streets, over-against <i>Arundel</i>-Buildings in the <i>Strand</i>;
but the gravity of his Age (being a Person between 50 and 60) invited
the Curiosity of Mr. <i>Cullin</i> the Baker, to ask this unknown
Person what he wanted? To which he replied, He wanted a Lodging. Upon
this, Mr. <i>Cullin</i> very courteously made answer, He should be
welcome to his House; which he very easily and readily accepted; and
accordingly was received very kindly. Now having no extraordinary Stock
of Money, <i>viz.</i> but Two Shillings in his Pocket, he was exposed
to the necessity of making use of some Romantick Narrative of his
Quality and Condition, to make good his Quarters with so slender a
Purse, to hold out payment. Accordingly the Curiosity of his Landlady
enquiring what Country-man he was? He replied, <i>Oxfordshire</i>; that
his Name was <i>Wickham</i>, a Person of a good Estate near
<i>Banbury</i>; and that the occasion of his coming to Town, was only
to avoid the payment of 500<i>l.</i> which he stood engaged for by
Bond, in behalf of a Person that was run away, and had left him to pay
that Money, and which truly he had made an Oath to himself he would
never pay; not that the Summ was so considerable to a Man of his
plentiful Fortune, only he was resolved to keep his Vow; and that had
made him retire a little from being arrested for it.
</p>

<p>
The Affability and good Language of this Person of imaginary Quality,
soon found Credit with his believing Landlord and Landlady, and no
Caress was thought kind enough to a Person of his eminent Figure and
Extraction. His first entrance into this indulgent Family was about a
fortnight before <i>Christmass</i>, where he gained that daily ground,
that no Respect could be sufficiently paid him: His little Pocket
Strength signified nothing, for his Host was not a little exalted with
the Honour of such a Guest under his Roof.
</p>

<p>
But, as Providence was pleased to order it, his Reign was ordain'd to
be but short; for he soon fell into a languishing Sickness, in which
time neither Doctor, Apothecary, Nurse, or any other Assistance was
wanting.
</p>

<p>
Now our pretended Captain, what ever other Faults he had, was resolv'd
not to be guilty of Ingratitude, and accordingly made an ample Last
Will and Testament, and most liberally gave extraordinary large
Donations and Legacies to his kind Landlord, <i>&#38;c.</i>
</p>

<p>
It was very remarkable, that during his Sickness, his Landlord, being
Overseer of the Poor, had requested a kind Brother in Office, the
Church-Warden, to pay a small Office of Christian Duty to this poor
languishing Gentleman; who making him a condoling Visit, with wet Eyes
and uplifted Hands, was so kind as to wish his Worship's Soul
everlasting Rest, which was seconded by many a repeated sigh from the
rest of the Condolers about him: And one more especially, having heard
of this great Wind-fall, lamented much his Unhappiness, in not visiting
this Gentleman, saying, <i>He was never born to do himself good, having
lost by his Negligence at least</i> 1000<i>l.</i> Also another eminent
Man of the Parish, being dissatisfied that he did not come in for a
Share with the rest of his Neighbours, went and told them, <i>That the
Coroner ought to be sent for, and an Enquiry made how he died</i>.
</p>

<p>
All Care and Application signified but little, for his last <i>Exit</i>
was drawing on; in which time, not in the least to shrink from his
Character of Quality, he still kept up the Honourable Figure he had so
long presented; and accordingly made most prodigious Protestations of
Good-will and Acknowledgments to the Family, avowing that the few
Hundreds he had bequeathed them, was nothing to what he would do for
'em, if please God to lengthen his Life to serve them and theirs.
</p>

<p>
And now having performed the Part of a good Patron and Friend, as his
last Legacies do sufficiently testifie; he was resolved to be as good a
Christian too, and thereupon requested the taking the Sacrament: To
which, being admitted (with what Integrity you'll find by the Sequel)
with a grave Countenance to the very last, he was very ready to receive
the Sacrament; and upon so serious an Undertaking, was pleased to put a
Case of Conscience to the Minister, <i>viz.</i> having made a Vow never
to pay the 500<i>l.</i> he stood engaged for, Whether he was obliged to
keep his Vow, or no? To which being answered in the Negative, That he
was obliged to pay his Debts, notwithstanding his rash Vow. He made
answer, That truly now drawing near Heaven, he considered the point,
and acquiesced with his Ghostly Monitor; and thereupon incerted the
500<i>l.</i> into the Will.
</p>

<p>
This piece of extraordinary Justice being perform'd with a very
composed and setled mind he left this troublesom World on <i>Sunday</i>
the Third Instant, seeming very well contented to part with his great
Riches and Lands, for the more valuable consideration of future
Happiness.
</p>

<p>
Now I must do the Family this Right, That notwithstanding the great
Sums they gain'd by so ample a Testament, and such bounteous Legacies,
however their sorrow for the lamented Departure of so worthy a
Gentleman was very hearty and cordial: Nay, some are of Opinion, that
instead of diminishing (as Sorrow generally wears off) theirs, on the
contrary is daily encreasing.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps nothing was so unkind as excluding the poor Prentice from
visiting the sick Gentleman. For, alas, the poor Boy has been heard
most dolefully to bewail the unkindness of his Master; for undoubtedly
the worthy Gentleman would have left him enough to have set him up, had
he been amongst the Throng of Visitants, who all tasted so highly of
his extravagant Liberality.
</p>

<p>
Now to assure you that the Kindness of his Executors continued beyond
his Death, they thought themselves so far indebted to his Memory, that
not only the Embalmer was sent for, but likewise a Coffin, price
12<i>l.</i> was made, and all little enough for so generous a Patron,
so much as Mourning, and Rings, and what else bespoken, <i>&#38;c.</i>
</p>

<p>
But before these Honourable Exequies could be performed, an unhappy
Letter from the True <i>Humphrey Wickham</i> Esq; a Person of a great
Estate and Reputation, detected the whole Fraud and Delusion, and the
Remains of our <i>Quandam</i> Person of Honour was committed to Earth,
in a Coffin, price 4<i>s.</i> with Shrowd and other Funeral Materials
accordingly.
</p>

<p>
You are hereby informed, That this grand Impostor, whose true Name was
<i>VVilliam Morrell</i> alias <i>Bowyer</i>, formerly a Surgeon in
<i>Banbury</i>, had been two Months a Guest at Mr. <i>Wickham</i>'s,
and thereby so acquainted with his Family as enabled him to personate
the Cheat so artificially, and so we leave him.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
